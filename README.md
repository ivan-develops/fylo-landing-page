## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Managing the sections was challenging, especially considering the content was contained in a separate container. There are still ways to handle `container` classes that need further development.
